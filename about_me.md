					<h3>Third-culture Kid</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Being a Korean who was born and raised in Indonesia is like being in a busy intersection. You are exposed to various cultures and the interactions between them. I am grateful to have the opportunities of a third-culture kid, such as being able to eat Kimchi with Indomie. I also embrace diversity as most of my friends come from different walks of life, giving me insight into the nuanced cultures of the world.</p>

					<h3>Hobbies</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As you can probably tell from the previous section, I love eating food. My favorite cuisines are Korean, Indonesian, Chinese, and Japanese food. Other than eating, I love playing badminton. I also love listening to EDM while working out at the gym. My favorite genres of EDM at the moment are Hardstyle and Future Bass/Melodic Dubstep. If you are also a fan of electronic music, rap, rock/metal, or pop, we are going to be good friends.</p>
