			<h2>Hi!</h2>
		</header>
		<p>My name is Chang Min Bark and I am an undergraduate Computer Science & Engineering Major at Bucknell University (Class of 2026). I am also pursuing a degree in Business Management as well as a minor in Mathematics. I was born in Surabaya, Indonesia, but both my parents are Korean. Please feel free to contact me! I would love to connect with anyone.</p>

					<h3>Third-culture Kid</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Being a Korean who was born and raised in Indonesia is like being in a busy intersection. You are exposed to various cultures and the interactions between them. I am grateful to have the opportunities of a third-culture kid, such as being able to eat Kimchi with Indomie. I also embrace diversity as most of my friends come from different walks of life, giving me insight into the nuanced cultures of the world. The picture on the left is of my close friend and me relaxing in a pool in Bali.</p>

					<h3>Hobbies</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As you can probably tell from the previous section, I love eating food. My favorite cuisines are Korean, Indonesian, Chinese, and Japanese food. Other than eating, I love playing badminton; I am the current president of the Badminton Club at Bucknell University. I also love listening to EDM while working out at the gym. My favorite genres of EDM at the moment are Hardstyle and Future Bass/Melodic Dubstep. If you are also a fan of electronic music, rap, rock/metal, or pop, we are going to be good friends. The picture on the right is of me eating a turkey leg at Disneyland.</p>
