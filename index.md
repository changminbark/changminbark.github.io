		<h3>ML Research/Infrastructure & Open Source Development</h3>
		<p>My work centers on building robust machine learning infrastructure and contributing to cutting-edge open source projects. I actively contribute to Kubernetes, specifically the inference-perf project, and KServe, working on performance optimization and scalability for ML model serving. My focus is on creating efficient, production-grade systems that enable AI/ML applications at scale. Previously, I conducted research on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where I modified and enhanced models with the Adam optimizer, meticulously analyzing parameters and gradients to understand training dynamics. I also explored time-series forecasting using deep echo state networks for stock price prediction. This combination of infrastructure engineering and research drives my passion for making machine learning systems more accessible and performant.</p>

		<h3>Application/Web Development</h3>
		<p>In my application and web development endeavors, I've embarked on diverse projects showcasing my proficiency across various tech stacks. Notable among these is Destinex, where I led a cross-functional team using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to create a platform for ordering deliveries and services overseas, improving data processing speed by 30% and reducing server response time by 25%. I have also contributed as a Fullstack developer to the TedXBucknell University website. Additionally, I've undertaken significant work in backend engineering, such as optimizing the notification system at Hangry Indonesia, where I rewrote processes in Golang, achieving a 90% efficiency boost, and implemented a Redis Streams-based message queue, reducing cloud hosting costs by 70%. My repertoire also includes sentiment analysis projects using AI/ML for company sentiment tracking from Google News data, alongside various in-class projects, from Java Spring Boot implementations to Python-based ventures, enriching my development portfolio further.</p>

		<h3>Entrepreneurship & Startups</h3>
		<p>I'm passionate about building innovative technology startups that solve real-world problems. Currently, I'm developing ventures at the intersection of AI and practical applications, including Chiron (chiron-ta.com), an agentic teaching assistant that leverages AI to enhance education. My entrepreneurial journey combines deep technical expertise in ML infrastructure with strategic business thinking, cultivated through hands-on experience building and launching products. I actively engage with startup ecosystems through platforms like BizPitch, collaborating with talented teams to transform ideas into scalable solutions. My vision is to build impactful technology companies with roots in both Indonesia and the US, creating products that serve global markets while staying grounded in solving meaningful challenges.</p>
